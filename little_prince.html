      As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. 
      <span class="underlineClass"> I felt deeply moved,and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</span>
      <span class="orangeHighlight"> It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span>
      In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his lock of hair that trembled in the wind, and said to myself:
      <span class="redWord"> "What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..." </span>
      As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself again: 
      <span class="redWord"> "What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is alseep..." </span> 
      And I felt him to be more fragile still. 
      <span class="underlineClass"> I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</span>
